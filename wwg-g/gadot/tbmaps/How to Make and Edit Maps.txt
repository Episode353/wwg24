All Maps are made inside of Trenchbroom

For simplicity, a portable copy is included in the WWG Folder called "trenchbroom"
Open Trenchbroom.exe, and you can make a new map or edit any maps

Maps are stored inside Gadot/Tbmaps and are compiled in gadot, so the .map can be edited
by anyone or everyone at anytime

To build the map in gadot, Open the World Scene, Select the Tbloader node, and
click the "Build Meshes" button on top of the scene view
